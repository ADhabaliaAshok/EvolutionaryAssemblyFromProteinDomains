Figure 2D, 2E, 2F are created to show the different distributions of orthogroups


## Description of the data and file structure
Figure 2D is to show the distribution of orthogroups with Latent Genetic Potential
Figure 2E is to show the distribution of all orthogroups and stress-relevant orthogroups
Figure 2F is to show the distribution of cyanobacterial orthogroups

## Code/Software
Code part 1: Figure 2D - The 96 orthogroups in this figure have been selected based on two filters which are as follows:
	1. Orthologs in Land Plants (Embryophyta)
	2. Protein Domains in embryophytes and non-Embryophyta species

Code part 2: Figure 2E – The number of orthogroups exclusive to each lineage are shown in a sequential order at every node

Code part 3: Figure 2F – The number of orthogroups exclusive to each lineage and Cyanobacterial species

Software: Affinity desginer was used to design the trees
