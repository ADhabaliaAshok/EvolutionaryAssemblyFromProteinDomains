No specific script was used to make this plot. Explanation for what was done and why is given below:

From the following file, orthogroups at node between two lineages are retrieved that are responsible for latent genetic potential in terms of protein domains:
/Users/amra/Documents/PLOTS/Scripts/Figure4_JandV/C_BubbleHeatmap/result/6_2475OG_input_file_EmbryophyteLCA

There are two numbers x/y:
x: The number of orthogroups tha have complete domain set in the at least one of the lineages before the node in consideration.
y: The number of orthogroups that have complete domain set in the lineage just before the node in consideration.
For example, 96/3 at node a means the following:
96 orthogroups are present in Embryophytes that have complete domain set in Streptophyte algae, Chlorophyte algae and Cyanobacteria
5 orthogroups are present in Embryophytes that have a complete domain set in Zygnematophyceae

Note: Our further analyses is done with 96 orthogroups referred to in above example. This is because we are interested in latent genetic potential involved in successful terrestrialization of plants.
